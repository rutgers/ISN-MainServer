Things we have done on 10/27/2016:

0)Clone the ISN-MainServer so we have a working version for ourselves

1)installed repositories for the stuff jeremy made,
code:
npm i

2)installed eslint which updates our server everytime we make changes to check if it still works, 
code:
npm i -D eslint eslint-watch

3)then initialized eslint in the root directory, 
code:
eslint --init

4)we made a script in the JSON file which runs eslint everytime we make changes,--fix will fix any js errors, the -w will watch the current directory(indicated by .)
code:
"lint": "esw --fix -w .",

5)installed a plugin for eslint which makes it more compatable with angular syntax, code:
npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-angular

plugins:
	-angular

7)add a global variable for angular in the eslint file, code:
